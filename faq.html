				<h4>Is there a beginner course?</h4>
				</br>
				<p>Yes, we have a beginners course.<br>
				It starts in September and each week covers a different topic, eg. anchor, release.
				This course will be run in the first semester only.<br>
				It will cover recurve but if you would like to learn barebow we have members which can train you.<br>
				At the end of the beginners course we hold a beginners competition, with a prize for the winners.<br>
				If you join late don't worry the coaches will teach you, you just need to tell them where you are 
				in your training, eg. complete beginner/stance/anchor and the coach can work from there</p>
